All files here are based on the work of [Francesc Campoy](https://campoy.cat/). I'd just like to thank him for doing this video series.

While all of these projects are based on his original work, they are all my own interpretation of the methods he is using. So don't use these as a way to follow along with his videos. You can find the proper code on his own [justforfunc repository](https://github.com/campoy/justforfunc).
