All files here are based on the work of [Francesc Campoy](https://campoy.cat/). I'd just like to thank him for doing this [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL64wiCrrxh4Jisi7OcCJIUpguV_f5jGnZ).

While all of these projects are based on his original work, they are all my own interpretation of the methods he is using. Don't use these as a way to follow along with his videos. You can find the proper code on his own [justforfunc repository](https://github.com/campoy/justforfunc).
